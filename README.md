## About Project
I have an Android Project called VNotes, you can check the repo <a href="https://github.com/quiet-programmer/hive_note_app">Here.</a> I want to implement a cloud feature fo it, I used Firebase but then decided to build an API for it, since I am still learning Laravel, I saw it as a chance to learn more about the Laravel Framework working on my side projects.

I will be dropping each progress until I am done with the API. any pull request or sending or issues are welcomed as it will help me in learning also.
